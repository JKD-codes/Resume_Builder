# Resume/CV Builder
During an inter-college contest, I missed the lecture on “Resume making” at college. <br>
Instead of catching up with notes, I thought — why not build my own Resume Builder? 😅 <br>

✨ Presenting <b>Resumeitt</b> – A Resume / CV Builder made with <i>HTML, CSS & JavaScript</i><br>
 🔹 Live preview as you type <br>
 🔹 Multiple templates (Modern / Classic) <br>
 🔹 Custom fonts, colors & backgrounds <br>
 🔹 Export your resume as a crisp PDF in one click <br>

This was also my first time deploying a website with Netlify — super smooth experience! 🚀<br>

👉 Try it live here: https://resumeitt.netlify.app/ <br>

Turns out missing a lecture was the best excuse to create something useful 🙌<br>
Would love to hear what you think!
